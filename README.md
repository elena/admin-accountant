# Admin Accounting

Current Django version: 1.11.2
Author: Elena Williams

** VERY OPINIONATED **

For quick-start accounting for people who have been forced to do a lot of it,
and are accustomed to getting the crappy end.

Intended as an app that just works, aiming to reduce busy-work and duplication.
If you want to use it as a reusable, go at it, intentionally starting from the
other way around rather than going through the dependency hell of retrofitting
a project for something whose most common use-case will be stand-alone.

The reason for all the inheretance is to ensure that the fields used are similar.
